# NOTE: The packager is not only used in calendar/lightning but should be
# general enough to be able to repackage other sub-extensions like
# calendar/providers/gdata. This means no lightning-specific files, no version
# numbers directly from lightning and be careful with relative paths.

# This packager can be used to repackage extensions. To use it, set the
# following variables in your Makefile, then include this file.
#   XPI_NAME = lightning # The extension path name
#   XPI_PKGNAME = lightning-2.2.en-US.mac # The extension package name
#   XPI_VERSION = 2.2 # The extension version
#
# For the upload target to work, you also need to set:
#   LIGHTNING_VERSION = 2.2  # Will be used to replace the Thunderbird version
#   						 # in POST_UPLOAD_CMD
